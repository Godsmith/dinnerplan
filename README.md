# Dinner Plan
Webapp for meal planning written in meteor.js, deployed at dinner-plan.herokuapp.com

## Setting up tests
1. Install node 4+
2. Install chimp (https://chimp.readme.io/docs/installation)
   As of writing this, only installing chimp locally works (though I haven't tried with nvm or
   any of the sort), and if run on Windows, only chimp@0.34 is working.
