# Dinner Plan
Webapp for meal planning written in meteor.js, deployed at dinner-plan.herokuapp.com



## Setting up tests

NB! Currently not working, since I could not deploy with chimp as dependency,
and Chimp does not seem to work anyway.

1. Install meteor.
2. Install node 4+.
3. Install chimp (https://github.com/xolvio/chimp). In Windows, only installing locally works: npm install chimp 
4. Run chimp_all.sh in Git Bash.
